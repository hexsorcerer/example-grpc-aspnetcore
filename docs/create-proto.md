## Creating a proto file
To create a gRPC service, you must create a proto file. This file represents the
contract of your gRPC service, and provides a schema for the messages that can
be sent and received.

In the interest of conciseness, I won't go into too much detail on the proto
file, but it's actually fairly straightforward. If you would like to dig into
the details, you can check out the
[official documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)
from Google.
